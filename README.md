# My Portfolio Website

Hey there! 👋 This is my personal portfolio website built with Flask.

## What I Built

A clean, modern portfolio site featuring:
- Interactive particle background (using p5.js)
- Responsive design that works on all devices
- Dark theme with monospace fonts
- Sections for Home, About, Experience, Projects, and Contact

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Graphics**: p5.js for the cool particle effects
- **Icons**: Font Awesome

## How to Run It

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the app**:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. **Open your browser** and go to: `http://localhost:5001`
