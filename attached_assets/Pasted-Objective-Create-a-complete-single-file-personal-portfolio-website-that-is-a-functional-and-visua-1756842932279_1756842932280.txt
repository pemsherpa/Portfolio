Objective:

Create a complete, single-file personal portfolio website that is a functional and visual replica of https://p5aholic.me/. The website must use my personal information, which is provided below. The final output should be a single index.html file that contains all necessary HTML, CSS (in a <style> tag), and JavaScript (in a <script> tag), including the p5.js library for the interactive background.

Key Features & Requirements:

Technology: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Interactive Background: Recreate the signature interactive particle/constellation effect from https://p5aholic.me/ using the p5.js library. This background should be present on the entire page and respond to mouse movement.

Design & Layout:

Theme: Dark mode, with a black or very dark grey background and light grey/white text, matching the reference site.

Typography: Use a clean, monospaced font throughout the site (e.g., 'Courier New', 'monospace').

Layout: A single-page, vertically scrolling layout with distinct sections for Home, About, Experience, Projects, and Contact.

Responsiveness: The website must be fully responsive and look great on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
